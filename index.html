    <p1>6.32pm, Stumps, Day 4 Bangladesh walk off the victors for the third day in a row. It's safe to say now - Bangladesh are poised for a ><br>win and it will be up to New Zealand to bat out of their skins for a long, long time tomorrow to change that. Keep up the discipline the bowling has shown all game, and a historic day beckons for Bangladesh. At one point, it seemed like they were letting the moment slip - poor use of DRS, poor fielding, and a partnership building. But Ebadot pulled out what will go down as one of the most iconic spells in Bangladesh cricket if they manage to win from here. Three wickets for zero runs once New Zealand had erased the deficit. The match suddenly looks very, very different because of it. It's Ross Taylor, who has one step out the door in this format, and Rachin Ravindra, who has only just got a foot in, <br>
        who will have to do the bulk of the work for the home side tomorrow. They are effectively 17 for 5 now. We'll be back at the start tomorrow.</p1>
